/*This program runs a new version of the card game, War.  In this game, the player will play 
against the computer.  A card will be drawn by each game participant (player and 
computer).  The winner of the round will get to keep both cards.  The new rules for this are 
each player can peek at their card and decide to pull an additional card out of a pile on the 
side or push this card onto a pile on the side.  Should the participant push the card, they will 
draw a new card from their deck and only be able to play that one card this round.  Should 
the participant pull a card from their side pile, they must play both cards this round.  The 
winner of the round is determined by the sum of the face value of the cards being higher 
than the opponent.  Ties go to the computer.  If a participant runs out of cards in their deck, 
they must play cards from their side pile.  If a participant runs out of cards in there deck and 
side pile, they lose.  */
